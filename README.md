# G6 Hitter Squashing V.2 🏓🌸🎯

## Overview 🌟

The **G6 Hitter Squashing Simulation** is a web-based application created as an assignment for the FIBO (Institute of Field Robotics) subject **Robotics Studio I: Science in Motion (FRA163)**. The web app simulates the distance a ball travels when hit with a specific angle 🎾, with other factors such as initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution being customizable through the settings ⚙️. This project is designed with a cute and user-friendly interface 💖 to make your trauma simulation just like a rainbow 🌈 and a sip of matcha on a spring day 🍵❀

## 🌟 Features

- 📌 **Zone Mapping** — Add, edit, or reset squash zones.  
- 🧮 **Physics Calculator** — Tell you the most suitable settings for your machine!
- 🎛️ **Custom Settings** — Change racket velocity, mass, and restitution.  
- 💅 **Cute UI** — Because squash deserves some sparkle too ✨
