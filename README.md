# 🎾 G6 Squash Trainer Simulator 💥

Welcome to **G6: Hitter Squashing** — a friendly and fun squash physics simulator made with 💖 by Group 6!

This little app lets you:
- Simulate squash hits using physics 🎯  
- Customize racket velocity, mass & more 🧪  
- Map and manage hitting zones 🗺️  
- Visualize results like angle, time, and distance 📊
